<h3>About me</h3>
Motivated and passionate tech enthusiast graduating in May 2023, seeking an internship in web development, software development, data analysis, or quality assurance testing. Proficient in Python, C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and completed bootcamps in areas such as machine learning, cloud computing, and UI/UX design. Ready to leverage skills and experience to tackle new challenges and contribute to impactful projects.

<h3>What I'm Working On</h3>
🔭 I'm currently engaged in several exciting projects that are helping me develop and refine my skills in key areas. These include data analysis projects using <b> Python and R, software development projects using GUI frameworks such as PyQt and Tkinter, and web development projects that require both front-end expertise in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as back-end proficiency in PHP. </p> Through these projects, I'm building a robust professional portfolio that showcases my abilities and my passion for innovation and problem-solving. I'm committed to delivering top-quality results and continually advancing my knowledge and skillset, in order to make meaningful contributions to any team or organization I'm part of.

<h3>What I'm Working On</h3>
🌱  I have a strong foundation in several programming languages, including <b>Python, C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</b>. Through personal projects and ongoing learning, I have developed proficiency in these languages and can apply them to a variety of contexts.

Recently, I had the opportunity to showcase my web development skills by winning the Ideathon Code Challenge at BMCC with a functional, responsive website that I designed and developed. This experience demonstrated my ability to manage complex projects and deliver high-quality results on time.

Furthermore, I have completed several bootcamps that have deepened my knowledge in key areas such as machine learning, cloud computing services, UI/UX design, and IT services and programming. I am excited to leverage this experience and continue developing my skills in these areas to contribute to innovative and impactful projects.

<h3>How I Can Help</h3>
👯  I'm always eager to collaborate on design and creative projects, as well as data analysis, machine learning, and DevOps projects and experiences.
